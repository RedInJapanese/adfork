# A simple adventure game by Akash Basu based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

## Code requirements:
- The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player
- The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).
- 3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).
- Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes


## Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: satisfied (name at least 4 of the classes): **Room1, Room2, Room3, Room4, DoorA, DoorB, Room5**
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Room 3 has two buttons and Room 4 has two doors**
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: satisfied **Button A and Button B both have pointerover messages describing what they are**
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Button A has a pointer down effect in which text appears saying its the wrong button while shaking and Passcode has a pointer down effect in which there is a message saying you took it and it fades away. There is also text in Room 5 that has an animation in which it comes in from the top.**
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Button A has a shaking animation and the Passcode has a fade away animation**
