# D3 Assignment

## Code requirements:
- The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player `(Level 1, 2, and 3)`
- The player’s goal can only be achieved indirectly `(Level 1, 2, and 3)`
- 3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (Showin in `script.js`).
- Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes`(three scenes contianing monkeys in script.js)`
