# A simple adventure game by Akash Basu based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

## Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: satisfied (name at least 4 of the classes). **This requirement is satisfied through the Map and Rooms 2,3,4, Door A, and Door B.**
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: satisfied (name the classes). **The Intro and Outro classes of the game are non adventure scenes.** 
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: **satisfied (Players can now access a map emoji at the bottom of the screen to look at a map and return to whatever room they were in. This allows players to navigate through rooms in an easier fashion)**
    - Enhancement 2: **satisfied (Players have a restart button at the bottom right which allows them to start the game again from room 1 which saves players the time of having to make it to the end screen in order to restart)**

## Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: satisfied (name at least 4 of the classes): **Room1, Room2, Room3, Room4, DoorA, DoorB, Room5**
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Room 3 has two buttons and Room 4 has two doors**
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: satisfied **Button A and Button B both have pointerover messages describing what they are**
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Button A has a pointer down effect in which text appears saying its the wrong button while shaking and Passcode has a pointer down effect in which there is a message saying you took it and it fades away**
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: satisfied (describe two examples): **Button A has a shaking animation and the Passcode has a fade away animation**
